# maven-utils

Helper scripts around [Apache Maven][maven]¹ usage.

All these scripts are *NOT* speed optimized!
I'm using these scripts often in my daily work, and they do what they have to do.

A file located in `lib/` and/or the file name starts with a `_` is primarily for used to include (source) into other scripts. These files providing global re-usable functions and should not be executed directly.

More and deeper documentation could be found in [`doc/`](./doc/).

And, YES, I know that manipulating XML files with [GNU core-utils][core-utils]⁵ like `sed` and `awk` is not recommended to use.
I'll take a deeper look on [`xml-coreutils`][xml-coreutils] or [`XMLStarlet`][xmlstarlet].

## 1. Requirements

Most of these scripts are requires UNIX/Linux standard tools and commands like:

* [GNU core-utils][core-utils]⁵
* [GNU bash][bash]⁶

All scripts are daily used with `GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin17)` on macOS High Sierra and also tested with:

* `GNU bash, Version 4.4.12(3)-release (x86_64-unknown-cygwin)` on [_Cygwin_ 2.11.1][cygwin]
* `GNU bash, version 4.4.19(2)-release (x86_64-pc-msys)` on [_Git for Windows_ 2.18.0][git-bash]

Each script checks the required tools and exits with an error if a required tool is not available.
Please check the script documentation for additional and/or deviating requirements.

## 2. Install and Usage

Clone this repository and add it to your `PATH` environment variable.

Most of these scripts has a _help_-option (`-h`, `-?`), a _quiet_-option (`-q`) and a multi-level _verbose_-option (`-vv...`).

The _usage_ information will be displayed if a script will execute without any arguments or with a help-option (`-h`, `-?`).

## 3. [Bulk change of dependency artifact version](./doc/set-dependency-version.md "doc/set-dependency-version.md")

The main intention of scripts with the name prefix `set-dependency-version` is to change the artifact version in a bulk.

The most of these provided scripts are working on [Apache Maven][maven]¹ [POM][maven-pom] files.
Additionally, for Eclipse RCP development, there are more interesting files which has to manipulate too.
These files are a bunch of XML and non-XML files which have to manipulate easy.

These scripts are not using [Apache Maven][maven]¹, rather they based on search-and-replace pattern in specific files (`pom.xml`, `MANIFEST.MF` ...).

See [here](./doc/set-dependency-version.md "doc/set-dependency-version.md") for more information about this kind of scripts.

## 4. [Bulk change of the parent artifact version](./doc/set-parent-version.md "doc/set-parent-version.md")

The main intention of this script is to change the version of the parent artifact in a bulk of [Apache Maven][maven]¹ [POM][maven-pom] files.

See [here](./doc/set-parent-version.md "doc/set-parent-version.md") for more information about this script.

## 5. [Create Graphviz DOT² (graph description language) file of all dependencies](./doc/dot-dependencies.md "doc/dot-dependencies.md")

This kind of scripts creates a [Graphviz DOT][graphviz-dot]² file with a graph of all dependencies.

See [here](./doc/dot-dependencies.md "doc/dot-dependencies.md") for more information about these scripts.

## 6. Maven Pull Request Validator

The Maven Pull Request Validate script (`maven-pr-validator.sh`) based — with small modification — on a script by [@jvanzyl][jvanzyl] and the original script could be found at his [*GitHub*Gist][maven-pr-validator].

> This script will checkout Maven, apply a PR, build the Maven distribution and run the Maven integration tests against the just-built distribution. If you successfully get to the end of this script then your PR is ready to be reviewed.

## 7. ShellCheck

[ShellCheck][shellcheck]³ is a static analysis tool for shell scripts and I'm use it to check my scripts and try to prevent pitfalls.
[ShellCheck][shellcheck]³ must be configured with the extended option [`-x`][SC1091] to validate these scripts correctly.

## 8. License

All these scripts, expect `maven-pr-validator.sh`, are licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0][apl]⁴.

## 9. Attic

The directory `_attic` is the place where the old and not supported scripts will be moved into it. These scripts are not maintained anymore.
